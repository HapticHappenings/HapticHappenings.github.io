        <p id="intro-blurb">A team of young curators from Durham present an exhibition of youth artwork addressing personal identity and lived experiences. With a grant from the Durham Youth Leadership Fund for the 2023-24 season, the Haptic Happenings team aims to broaden Durham’s idea of how fine art can be made, exhibited, and interacted with by our youth community.</p>

        <h1>Exhibiting in the Summer of 2024</h1>
        <p>Haptic Happenings will be open to the public during a month long exhibition at a gallery venue in Durham, North Carolina. Our medium-sized exhibition will feature 50 pieces from local artists aged 13-24,&nbsp;with no limits imposed on media form or artistic discipline. We invite visitors to immerse themselves in all the different textures, colors, feelings, and forms that represent the way these youth artists see themselves at this moment.<br><br>We believe that art is a tool for radical positive change and that young people deserve the opportunity to share their creative expression with the world.&nbsp;In an effort to make participation as accessible as possible, the Haptic Happenings project provides both material and financial support directly to Durham’s youth. In addition to the exhibition opportunity, we will provide free art supplies prior to collecting work to any young artist in Durham, so that if someone wishes to enter but has no means or supplies, applying can still be achievable. We will also pay each participating artist a $100 honorarium for their work to be included in the final exhibition. <br><br>Exhibition visitors are encouraged to participate in an ongoing public vote for best-in-show, which will result in a first-place prize of&nbsp;$500, a second-place prize of $300, and a third-place prize of $180 being awarded at the closing reception.</p>

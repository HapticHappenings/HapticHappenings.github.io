        <h1>Our Team</h1>
        <h2>Faith Reagin</h2>
        <p class="left-aligned-text">Our youth curatorial team is led by Faith Reagin, a multimedia artist with past experience as a gallery assistant, preparator, and exhibition designer. Faith is supremely interested in the personal in art--in exploring the depths of memory and ephemeral moments within one’s life and sharing that. Faith loves all things art and strives to create a space within the art world that is welcoming and accessible to all kinds of people. Faith's current favorite artists are Julie Mehretu and Egon Schiele.</p>
        <h2>Ki Hickman</h2>
        <p class="left-aligned-text">Ki (pronounced “key”) is a Southern creative and social work practitioner who is passionate about community belonging. Throughout their practice Ki utilizies art as a tool to aid in transformative justice. Ki is excited to be on the Haptics Happening team allowing them to continue incorporating art into all facets of life bringing joy to day-to-day experiences.<br>Ki relies on their senses and intuition to guide them through their creative process, whether it is in the kitchen, delving into a fiber arts project, or holding space for community.</p>
        <h2>Nori McDuffie</h2>
        <p class="left-aligned-text">Nori facilitates the connections to other community members for the curatorial team. Nori is also a interdisciplinary artist who engages in various art forms such as photography, curating, archiving, storytelling, and experience-making. His work is a beautiful expression of his love, admiration, and reverence for Black culture, tradition, performance, spirituality, ephemera, and the human experience. Nori aims to inspire, challenge, encourage dialogue, encourage self-exploration, and interrogation of the world. Nori is also the Project Facilitator for Durham Powerful Arts Collectively (DurmPAC). DurmPAC wants to create a Durham where youth have spaces for artistic expression and engagement where they receive the nurturing love, healing, and support needed to shape and thrive in their communities. Recently, Nori has found inspiration from several artists, including Devan Shimoyama, Solange Knowles, Fritz Von Eric, Lyle Ashton Harris, Kerry James Marshall, and Terence Nstako Maluleke.</p>
        <h2>Jett Pavlica</h2>
        <p class="left-aligned-text">Web development and graphic design for the exhibition is provided by Jett Pavlica, a computational artist from Durham, North Carolina. Their work exists at the intersection of art and science, visualizing the output of countless computer programs operating harmoniously to color a pixel, project light on the wall, or drag a pen across paper. Jett is a founding member of the Durham Powerful Arts Collective, where they contribute to projects that provide accessible art experiences to the local youth community. Jett was recently blown away by an exhibit of the works of Gertrud Goldschmidt, p.k.a Gego.</p>
        <h2>Atom</h2>

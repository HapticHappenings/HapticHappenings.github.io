        <h1>Our Team</h1>
        <h2>Faith Reagin</h2>
        <p class="left-aligned-text">Our youth curatorial team is led by Faith Reagin, a multimedia artist with past experience as a gallery assistant, preparator, and exhibition designer. Faith is supremely interested in the personal in art--in exploring the depths of memory and ephemeral moments within oneâ€™s life and sharing that. Faith loves all things art and strives to create a space within the art world that is welcoming and accessible to all kinds of people. Faith's current favorite artists are Julie Mehretu and Egon Schiele.</p>
        <h2>Jett Pavlica</h2>
        <p class="left-aligned-text">Web development and graphic design for the exhibition is provided by Jett Pavlica, a computational artist from Durham, North Carolina. Their work exists at the intersection of art and science, visualizing the output of countless computer programs operating harmoniously to color a pixel, project light on the wall, or drag a pen across paper. Jett is a founding member of the Durham Powerful Arts Collective, where they contribute to projects that provide accessible art experiences to the local youth community. Jett was recently blown away by an exhibit of the works of Gertrud Goldschmidt, p.k.a Gego.</p>
